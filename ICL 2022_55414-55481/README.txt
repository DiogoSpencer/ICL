This project was made for the ICL class 2022/2023, made by Diogo Ramos 55481 and Jo√£o Palma 55414.

IMPORTANT: Gmail doesn't let us send a batch file as an annex so our script is in a text file called makeit that needs to be saved as .bat file before trying to run it.

To compile the program you must be in the source file directory and type .\makeit.bat to run the script.

If there is a problem running the script type:
 javacc ParserICL.jj
 javac ICLInterpreter.java
 java ICLInterpreter


We made the assignment for the Interpreter for a Level 1 language
We have some methods for compile in most of the AST classes but we ended up not completing the Compiler part of the assignment.

In this file you can also find some code examples to test our Interpreter Level 1
